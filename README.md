# Credit_Risk_Analysis
 Columbia Data Science Module 17

## Overview
Working from an anonymized dataset of LendingClub borrowers, I have used several different machine learning algorithms to gauge thecredit risk of borrowers. Credit risk datasets typically contain far more low risk borrowers than high risk borrowers, and this dataset is no exception. Because of this, the key distinction between the six different algorithms are the methods employed in compensating for the relative paucity of high risk borrowers. (After doing some initial data cleaning, there were 347 high risk borrowers and 68,470 non-high risk borrowers. I will compare model performance using naive oversampling, SMOTE oversampling, Clustered_Centroids undersampling, SMOTEENN oversampling/undersampling (combined), balanced random forest, and EasyEnsemble Classifier.
